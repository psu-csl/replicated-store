- Log
  # We can think of Log as an unbounded producer-consumer queue. From this
  # perspective, the execute method below acts as the consume method of the
  # queue, and the commit method below acts as the produce method of the queue.
  # Technically, instances are inserted into the queue via the append method;
  # however, they do not become executable until they are committed by calling
  # commit on the instance. Wake-up happens only one way: the thread that
  # commits wakes up the executor thread who executes instances by calling the
  # execute method.
  #
  # Since the executor thread may block on calling the execute method of log, we
  # need to wake up the executor when we want to cleanly shut down the system.
  # To this end, the log has a running flag and a stop method that sets the
  # running flag to false and signals the condition variable upon which the
  # executor thread is sleeping (due to calling the execute method). The execute
  # method will return a nullopt after the log is stopped and the executor
  # method can exit upon receiving nullopt.

  # log invariants
  #
  # given that (1) the instances in the log must be executed in order, (2)
  # last_executed is the index of the last executed instance, and (3)
  # global_last_executed is the index of the last instance that was executed in
  # all peers, our log has the following invariants:
  #
  # (i1) global_last_executed <= last_executed
  # (i2) all instances in [global_last_executed, last_executed] are executed
  # (i3) there is no executed instance after last_executed.
  # (i4) there are no instances at indices < global_last_executed

  - types/protobufs:

    - protobuf Command: a key-value command. Fields of a Command are
      - type_: enum { get, put, del }
      - key_: string
      - value_: string (valid only if type_ == put)

    - protobuf Instance: an entry in the log. Fields of an Instance are:
      - ballot_: ballot of the instance
      - index_: index of the command in the log
      - client-id_: id of the client in the leader that issued the command
      - state_: enum { in-progress, committed, executed }
      - command_: Command

      Each Instance starts in the in-progress state, and changes to the
      committed state once quorum has voted for it, and changes to executed
      state once the executor thread has its command executed.

  - members

    - running_: boolean indicating whether the log is still running.

    - kv_store_: a reference to the key-value store used by the execute command
      for executing key-value commands from the log.

    - log_: a map from int to Instance.

    - last_index_: index of the highest-numbered instance in the log. the log
      starts at index 1; therefore, last_index_ is initialized to 0, signifying
      an empty log.

    - last_executed_: index of the last executed instance. initialized to 0.

    - global_last_executed_: index of the last executed instance on all peers
      known to this peer. initialized to 0.

    - mu_: the mutex of the Log object that needs to be acquired before the
      object is modified.

    - cv_executable_: the condition variable on which the execute method sleeps
      and which the commit method signals.

    - cv_committable_: the condition variable on which the commit method sleeps
      on rare occasions and the append method signals.

    - append
      - common case test: appended members appear in the log at correct indexes.

    - append-with-gap
      - if we leave a gap in the log by appending an instance at last_index_ + m,
        where m > 1, then last_index_ should be updated to last_index_ + m.

    - append-fill-gaps
      - if we leave a gap in the log by appending an instance at last_index_ + m,
        where m > 1, and then append an instance at k, where last_index_ < k < m,
        then last_index_ does not change because the append operation is filling a
        gap and not extending the log.

    - append-high-ballot-override
      - if log_[m] contains an instance with ballot = n and we append an instance
        at log_[m] with ballot = o, where o > n, then append should overwrite the
        instance in the log.

    - append-low-ballot-no-effect
      - if log_[m] contains an instance with ballot = n and we append an instance
        at log_[m] with ballot = o, where o < n, then append should have no
        effect.

    - commit
      - committing an instance should change its state to committed; if there is a
        gap between last_executed_ and committed instance, then the log should not
        become executable; otherwise, it should.

    - commit-before-append
      - committing an instance at the index that does not yet have an instance
        because append wasn't called yet (see commit function description above
        for when this can happen) should eventually succeed after append is
        called.

        1 and 2 are committed and 3 is not, and the log is executable.

    - commit-until-higher-ballot
      - append instances at indexes 1, 2, and 3, and call commit_until with a
        higher ballot number and leader_last_executed = 3, ensure that none of the
        instances committed and the log is not executable.

    - commit-until-with-gap
      - append instances at indexes 1, 3, and 4, and call commit_until with the

        committed and 3 and 4 aren't, and the log is executable.

      - append instances at indexes 1, 2, and 3, and call commit_until with
        leader_last_executed = 3, and ensure that all instances are executed.

    - append-commit-until-execute-trim-until
      - append instances at indexes 1, 2, and 3, and call commit_until with the
        same ballot number and leader_last_executed = 3, and then call trim_until
        with leader_global_last_executed = 3, and ensure that all of the instances
        removed from the log.

    - append-at-trimmed-index
      - append instances at indexes 1 and 2, and call commit_until with the same
        ballot number and leader_global_last_executed = 2, and then call
        trim_until with leader_global_last_executed = 2 to move
        global_last_executed_ to 2. append an instance at index 1 and 2 again and
        ensure that it has no effect, i.e. there are no instances at index 1
        and 2.

      - append instances at indexes 1, 2, 3; call
        instances_since_global_last_executed and ensure that all instances are
        returned; call commit_until with the same ballot number and
        leader_last_executed = 2, and then call trim_until with
        leader_global_last_executed = 2 to move global_last_executed_ to 2. call
        instances_since_global_last_executed again, and ensure that only instance
        3 is returned.
